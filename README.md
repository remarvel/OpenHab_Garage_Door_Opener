# OpenHab_Garage_Door_Opener
Using Python to monitor and control garage doors with OpenHab

These are 3 python files that I have running on a Raspberry Pi in my garage that monitor the state of the garage doors, allow you to open or close the garage doors and there's also a parking monitor for my wife that turns LED's red, yellow or green based on how close she is to the wall. It is connected to OpenHab through MQTT. Probably not the most well written code but it does work.
